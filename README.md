## Features
- **Now Playing**: Displays the current track's album cover, title, & artist over a matching background.
- **User Screen**: While not playing, display your username & the scannable Spotify Code to your profile.

## Installation
### Hardware
Materials needed:
- [Raspberry Pi] (Only tested on 3B+ and 4B, but should work on other models)
- Adafruit RGB Matrix [HAT] or [Bonnet]
- RGB LED matrix (128Ã—64)

### Software
**Pre-requisites**

- Git
- PIP
- Python 3.7+

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git python3-pip -y
```

**Installation**

First, clone this repository. Using the `--recursive` flag will install the rgbmatrix binaries, which come from
hzeller's [rpi-rgb-led-matrix] library. This library is used to render the data onto the LED matrix.

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/feram18/now-playing.git
cd now-playing
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

Once installed, configure your Spotify credentials following these 
[instructions](https://github.com/feram18/now-playing/wiki/Configure-Spotify-Credentials).

**Updating**

From the `now-playing` directory, run the update script. The script will also take care of updating dependencies.

```sh
./update.sh
```

### Flags
The LED matrix is configured with the flags provided by the [rpi-rgb-led-matrix] library. 
More details on these flags can be found in the library's documentation.

```
--led-rows                Display panel rows. (Default: 64)
--led-cols                Display panel columns. (Default: 128)
--led-multiplexing        Multiplexing type: 0 = direct; 1 = strip; 2 = checker; 3 = spiral; 4 = Z-strip; 5 = ZnMirrorZStripe; 6 = coreman; 7 = Kaler2Scan; 8 = ZStripeUneven. (Default: 0)
--led-row-addr-type       Addressing of rows: 0 = default; 1 = AB-addressed panels. (Default: 0)
--led-panel-type          Chipset of the panel. Supported panel types: FM6126A; FM6127.
--led-gpio-mapping        Name of GPIO mapping used: regular, adafruit-hat, adafruit-hat-pwm, compute-module. (Default: regular)
--led-slowdown-gpio       Slow down writing to GPIO. Needed for faster Pi's and/or slower panels. Range: 0..4. (Default: 1)
--led-chain               Number of daisy-chained boards. (Default: 1)
--led-parallel            For Plus-models or RPi2: parallel chains. 1..3. (Default: 1)
--led-pixel-mapper        Apply pixel mappers: Mirror (Horizontal) = "Mirror:H"; Mirror (Vertical) = "Mirror:V"; Rotate (Degrees) = eg. "Rotate: 90"; U-Mapper = "U-mapper"
--led-brightness          Brightness level. Range: 1..100. (Default: 100)
--led-pwm-bits            Bits used for PWM. Range 1..11. (Default: 11)
--led-show-refresh        Shows the current refresh rate of the LED panel.
--led-limit-refresh       Limit refresh rate to this frequency in Hz. Useful to keep a constant refresh rate on loaded system. 0=no limit. (Default: 0)
--led-scan-mode           Progressive or interlaced scan. 0 = Progressive, 1 = Interlaced. (Default: 1)
--led-pwm-lsb-nanosecond  Base time-unit for the on-time in the lowest significant bit in nanoseconds. (Default: 130)
--led-pwm-dither-bits     Time dithering of lower bits. (Default: 0)
--led-no-hardware-pulse   Don't use hardware pin-pulse generation.
--led-inverse             Switch if your matrix has inverse colors on.
--led-rgb-sequence        Switch if your matrix has led colors swapped. (Default: RGB)
```

### Execution
From the `now-playing` directory run the command

```sh
sudo python3 main.py --led-gpio-mapping="adafruit-hat" --led-slowdown-gpio=3
```
Modify and include [flags](#Flags) as needed for your particular setup. Running as root is necessary in order for the 
matrix to render. Privileges are dropped after initialization.

### Debug
If you are experiencing issues, enable debug messages by appending the `--debug` flag to your execution command, logs 
are written to the `now-playing.log` file.

## Sources
This project relies on the following:
- [Spotipy] library to access Spotify data.
- [rpi-rgb-led-matrix] library to make everything work with the LED matrix. It is included into this repository as a 
  submodule.
